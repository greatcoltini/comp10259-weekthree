## Class Lecturing
- bootstrap was the first responsive website

### Container vs Container fluid
- container class has padding
- container-fluid has no padding; takes full page width

### Margins
- mt ; ml ; pb ; pr 
- my ; px ... 

### Grid system
- bootstrap works with a 12 item grid system

### Shortcuts for creation
- in VSCode can do
div.row>div.col-3*4
to create one row with 4 columns

div.row.border>div.col-1*12


### Responsive media
- can use different tags to adjust for different screens
for example, using col-sm-2 makes columns stack in mobile

for example 

col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12

means that in large, each column will take up 3 / 12 grid slots
              med  , each column will take up 6 / 12 grid slots
              small, each column will take up 12 / 12 grid slots
